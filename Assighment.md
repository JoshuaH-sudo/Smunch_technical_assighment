We would like to see this simple project built using Typescript and any full stack framework of your choice. You can use any relational database of your choice. The suggested tech stack is: Remix or a React application using React Router 6.4 for the frontend and Express backend

We love TDD, simplicity, creativity, and code cleanliness. Make sure to create a descriptive `readme.md` file and to tidy up your code bases.
